            <h2>Winter</h2>
            <div class="effect"><p>The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. 
                The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44Â° to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face
                 the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the
                  Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures
                   than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere 
                   is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower 
                   maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun. During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the 
                   Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of solar radiation strikes the
                    Earth per unit of surface area.In the Northern Hemisphere, some authorities define the period of winter based 
                    on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun), 
                    regardless of weather conditions</p> </div>

    <div class="seasons spring">
        <div class="coint2">
            <h2>Spring</h2>
            <div class="effect"><p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. 
                There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, 
                cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and
                 vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime 
                 length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the Summer Solstice in June 
                 (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern Hemisphere). Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also 
                 to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have 
                 climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have 
                 local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.</p>
